# Rush - Santa Claus

Use the annoted subject in the branch dev. It'll save a lot of time.

I likes bonuses.

## Branches

- master : rendu branch
- release : functionnal branch
- dev : developpement branch

## Annoted subject

- **yellow highlight** is for important general things
- **green highlight** is for output management (strings to copy...)
- **yellow inline notes** are for storing informations that you are sure they are true
- **light blue inline notes** are for subject imprecisions that need explanations

### Authors
